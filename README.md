# energy-monitor-and-diverter-espeasy D2 uno/wifi boards with espeasy install on the  esp8266 chip and  these sketched flashed to uno
- the sensor board is emontx arduino shield ...
the hz detection version suit able for any frequence grid  standard or non standard   uses  pin  as 9,10,3. and 11  as cascadeing ssr diversion
 pin 5 and 6 are used to  show  activity but can be used as ssr diversion too but only if on 60hz grids ( you can use it on other grigs  hz but accracy drops)
 
 you can display info on lcd screen or operate headless only using  espeasy to display info and send it to contoler software
  but if using  lcd  ct4  has to be disable  pull the pin or cut trace  on the shield going to A4 on the uno
